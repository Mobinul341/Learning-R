# Learning-R

The file "r_syntax.R" is containing basic R syntax. R is a high level programming language, but it is specially used in statistical field. There are some similarity and dissimilarity between R and Python. To understand the syntax of R, just follow the comments or "#" signs. R does not support multiline comment. This code can be run on R console, R studio or Shell terminal with the code-

Rscript filename.R

The file "r_special.R" has some basic syntax of the special data structures of R. The structures are- Vector, Factor, Matrix, List, Dataframe. These are in the base package so do not need to import any third party library like Python has Pandas or others. These data structures have made R more popular analytical programming language than others. As I have shown in previous "r_syntax.R" file, comment "#" signs is the identity of the block of code. Just like that in this file you need to follow the "#" comment sign.
